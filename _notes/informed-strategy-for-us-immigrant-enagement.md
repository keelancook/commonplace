## New Immigration as Missionary Occasion
The city is making a comeback. After a long period of decentralization that began in the 1920s with the birth of the automobile and the development of mass-produced housing, cities began to grow again in the United States. 

### Generational Shifts lead to Urban Boom: Millennials and Empty Nesters
 After a long period of decentralization away from city centers and into suburban and exurban settings in the United States, several key factors contributed to a reversal of this trend. While all the variables are far too diverse to cover, the generational shifts occuring in the United States population were a significant contributor to this trend. Pro-urban millennials moved into the city as a reaction to the suburban ideal, preferencing walkable, mixed-use spaces over strip malls and sprawl. In addition, as the boomer generation shifted into the empty next phase of life, many decided an urban environment provided levesl of convenience in retirement. Benjamin Ross writes, “A decade into the new millennium, waves of upscale newcomers had washed across the entire island of Manhattan; reached through San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon; and touched nearly every corner of Washington, DC."[[Benjamin Ross, *Dead End: Suburban Sprawl and the Rebirth of American Urbanism* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), 127.::rsn]] The trend is evident in many urban centers across America.

### The New Wave of Immigration
 In addition to generational shifts that have prompted a return to the city among majority culture groups, urban centers and their surrounding suburbs are the target destination for one of the largest immigration movements in world history. Today, immigration is poised to break a century-old record in the United States. With over 45 million foreign born residents, the United States is the biggest recipient of global migration by a wide margin. America has long been a receiver of immigrants; however, recent numbers may potentially pass those of America's largest immigration waves of the past. In 1890, the immigrant share of the U.S. population stood at 14.8 percent.[[Immigrant share is the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born.::rmn]] After 1920, this number dropped significantly. It reached an all-time low in 1970 at 4.7 percent. Today, recent immigrant share stands at 13.4 percent.[[Gustavo López, Kristen Bialik, and Posts, “[Key Findings about U.S. Immigrants](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/03/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/),” Pew Research Center, (May 3, 2017).::rsn]]
 


#### The Hart-Celler Act of 1965


 While the previous presidential administration restricted immigration significantly from 2016-2020, the new administration vows to reverse this trend and once again increase the flow of immigration to the United States.

### Not Just for the Big Cities
Mid-size urban centers are also seeing rapid diversification.
