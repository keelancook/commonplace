>It is my objective in this book not only to demonstrate (as many others have done) that Christian mission is fully grounded in the Scripture (though I deliberately pay more attention to its Old Testament roots than most books on the subject do), but also to demonstrate that a strong theology of the mission of God provides a fruitful hermeneutical framework within which to read the whole Bible (26).
