## Main Takeway
Newport's book is an excellent read on the current state of knowledge work, and more broadly on anyone in a white collar role. In particular, I think there is a large amount of overlap between those of us who serve in ministry roles and the strains and pressures on attention that Newport notes. 

This book is one I would quickly recommend to anyone whose work requires thoughtful prodcution of content. This is true for pastors, academics, ministry strategists, and even the growing number of knowledge workers in our church pews.

## Key Subjects Worth Exploring
* Deliberate Practice
* Solitude and Mindfulness
