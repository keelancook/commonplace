"Christianize and Civilize" was a common call of the [[Modern Missions Movement]] during the [[Era of Noncontextualization]]. In essence, social uplift (a term used as shorthand for Western cultural transmission) was appended to the evangelical mission of spreading the gospel to the nations. 
[[Need documented citations for this from other scolarship, secondary and primary. Can use McKinley's statement about the Phillippines as a quintessential example. But, I need statements from missions aganecies and others as well.::lmn]]


## Christianize and Americanize
This conflation of a gospel mission with cultural transmission can even be see in [[North American Missions]] during the [[Gilded Age]] and [[Progressive Era]], in the form of "Christianize and Americanize" that I refer to as [[Gilded Age Syncretism]]. This syncretism is closely related to the concept of the [[Conditional Manifest Destiny]] coined by Wendy Deichmann Edwards.[[Deichmann Edwards, Wendy J. “Forging an Ideology for American Missions: Josiah Strong and Manifest Destiny.” Pages 163–91 in [North American Foreign Missions, 1810-1914: Theology, Theory, and Policy](https://amzn.to/3tTjsSk).
