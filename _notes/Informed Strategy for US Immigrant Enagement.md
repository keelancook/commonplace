## New Immigration as Missionary Occasion
The city is making a comeback. After a long period of decentralization that began in the 1920s with the birth of the automobile and the development of mass-produced housing, cities began to grow again in the United States. This presents churches in North America with a rare opporunity to engage in cross-cultural missions to the diaspora like never before. For churches to see the full potential of this missionary occassion, they must first understand these tectonic shifts in the U.S. population that are leading a very different mission field outside their own front door.

### Generational Shifts lead to Urban Boom: Millennials and Empty Nesters
 After a long period of decentralization away from city centers and into suburban and exurban settings in the United States, several key factors contributed to a reversal of this trend. While all the variables are far too diverse to cover, the generational shifts occuring in the United States population were a significant contributor to this trend. Pro-urban millennials moved into the city as a reaction to the suburban ideal, preferencing walkable, mixed-use spaces over strip malls and sprawl. In addition, as the boomer generation shifted into the empty next phase of life, many decided an urban environment provided levesl of convenience in retirement. Benjamin Ross writes, “A decade into the new millennium, waves of upscale newcomers had washed across the entire island of Manhattan; reached through San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon; and touched nearly every corner of Washington, DC."[[Benjamin Ross, *Dead End: Suburban Sprawl and the Rebirth of American Urbanism* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), 127.::rsn]] The trend is evident in many urban centers across America.

### The New Wave of Immigration
 In addition to generational shifts that have prompted a return to the city among majority culture groups, urban centers and their surrounding suburbs are the target destination for one of the largest immigration movements in world history. Today, immigration is poised to break a century-old record in the United States. With over 45 million foreign born residents, the United States is the biggest recipient of global migration by a wide margin. America has long been a receiver of immigrants; however, recent numbers may potentially pass those of America's largest immigration waves of the past. In 1890, the immigrant share of the U.S. population stood at 14.8 percent.[[Immigrant share is the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born.::rmn]] After 1920, this number dropped significantly. It reached an all-time low in 1970 at 4.7 percent. Today, recent immigrant share stands at 13.4 percent.[[Gustavo López, Kristen Bialik, and Posts, “[Key Findings about U.S. Immigrants](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/03/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/),” Pew Research Center, (May 3, 2017).::rsn]] The immigrant share is its highest in a century, and this number represents unprecedented diversity. Unlike the first great wave of immigration, which brought primarily European immigrants from near-culture groups, the second wave of immigration is bringing people from everywhere except Europe.
 
### The Hart-Celler Act of 1965
This remarkable shift in immigrant share can be attributed to a key piece of legislature adopted in 1965. President Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act, known as the Hart-Celler Act, into law, making significant changes to the manner in which the United States received immigrants.[[Government Publishing Office, “[The Immigration and Nationality Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg911.pdf),” Catalog of U.S. Government Publications.::rsn]] The act removed previous legislation that restricted immigration by nationality. Before this, most immigration was limited to European countries. This change radically shifted the flow of immigration to the United States, opening up the doors to a truly global immigrant wave. Since this time, the immigrant share has continued to rise, and the nations populations diversify. In 2017, the Trump administration began to significantly restrict immigrationonce again; however, the new administration vows to reverse this trend and reopen the doors for immigration to the United States. If this holds true, the United States will most likely continue to see a rise in immigrant share and the American people will continue to diverisfy to new levels.

### Not Just for the Big Cities
Contrary to the assumption that diversity and immigrant populations are a "big city" phenomenon, the current wave of immigration is so pronounced it also affects small and mid-size urban centers as well. Towns like Dearborn, Michigan and Calrkston, Georgia are becoming bustling hubs for immigrant communities. In many smaller urban centers, ethnic enclaves are developing that serve as the largest collection of their respective people group in the world outside of their home country. Nashville, for instance, has the largest Kurdish population in the world outside of the Middle East.[[Monica Campbell, “[Visiting a Kurdish Capital in the US](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28891241),” BBC News (August 29, 2014).::rsn]] A 2015 Charlotte Observer article notes,
>In just 20 years, from 1990 to 2010, the percentage of Charlotte’s population that is foreign-born quintupled from about 3 percent to about 15 percent. Close to 114,000 immigrants, legal and not, call the city home. That’s about one in seven residents, a higher proportion than in Philadelphia, Milwaukee or Detroit.[[Robert Lahser, “[A New Era Needs a New Approach](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article16121978.html),” Charlotte Observer (March 23, 2015).::rsn]]

This phenomenon can be witnessed across the country, from Columbus, Ohio to Houston and everywhere in between.

### Super-Diversity is the New Normal
The radical diversity now found in these urban centers outstrips conventional language and terms. In 2007, Steven Vertovec coined the term "super-diversity" to refer to the phenomenon he was observing in London.[[Vertovec, Steven. “Super-Diversity and Its Implications.” Ethn. Racial Stud. 30.6 (2007): 1024–54.::rsn]] According to this concept of super-diversity, cultural diversity does not lead toward a minimizing of cultures or differenes, but toward the generation of even more cultures. Cities are collections of radically diverse groups that continue to increaes in complexity. Super-diversity is the stacking of cultures. worldviews, languages, and religions in the same space in such a way that it creates even more cultural groupings. 

While globalization does force cultural groups in the same geography to interact. the claim that globalization leads to assimiliation is dubious. Boundaries between cultures are porous, and the transmission of ideas does occur. Furthermore, subsequent generations occupy liminal spaces between multiple cultures. However, instead of homogenization, this actually leads to hybridization. Where there were two cultures, there are now three not one and a half. Paul Hiebert writes,
>One thing is increasingly clear: the world is not moving toward a greater homogenization. On the other hand, ethnographies reveal increasing growth of ethnic, national, and tribal identities in many parts of the world. On the other hand, locals are increasingly participating in global agendas.[[Hiebert, *Transformaing Worldviews*, 342.::rsn]]
Hibert points to twin forces at play concerning this phenomenon: globalization and localization. while globalization receives much attention, Hiebert notes the presence of a balancing force that fights for cultural permanences. In this sense, cultures are permeable but resilient, and that leads to the generation of additional cultural groups when they are placed on top of one another. 

Super-diversity, therefore, means that attempting some universal multicultural expression for mission within a city is woefully insufficient. While multiculturalism is a needed piece of the puzzle, any single solution strategy concerning contextual manifestations of the gospel in diverse North Amerian cities will fail to produce anything approaching gospel saturation. Instead, it will create new hidden peoples inside our cities.

### Ethnic Enclaves and Ethnoburbs
Cultural resilience, and the need for unique cultural manifestations of the gospel in cities, is best demonstrated by the existence of ethnic enclaves. Many of these enclaves have a longstanding history in the United States and date back over a hundred years to previous waves of immigrgation. Think of Little Italy or Chinatown in cities like New York and San Francisco.[[Fonner, *From Ellis Island to JFK*, 40, provides thorough descriptions of these historic enclaves in New York city.::rsn]] Over a century later, and these enclaves still allow for cultural resiliance and transmission for certain social norms. 

Ethnic enclaves are not a relic of previous immigration. New enclaves are still forming today, and many of the newest ones ecplipse historic ones in size and influence. Today's enclaves often emerge on the edges of urbdan centers. Howard Duncan calls these suburban enclaves "ethnoburbs." Duncan writes,
>The formation of ethnic enclaves is a natural development when minority populations reach a sufficient size, and they have become a feature of many of our cities … The rise of the ‘ethnoburb’ in North America is one example of how contemporary enclaves can become institutionally complete, middle class, able to offer not only comforting neighbourhoods but full services and amenities, not only jobs, but lucrative professional careers, in general an environment that can compete with the mainstream in its appeal.[[Duncan, "Some Modern Challenges to Social Inclusion in Highly Diverse Cities", 137.::rsn]]
Prime examples of these are located in Dearborn for Arabic peoples, Clarkston for a wide range of refugee communities, Little Kurdistan in Nashville's Nolensville Pile corridor, Mohatma Ghandi Square in Houston, and Little Ethiopia in Washington DC.

Growing up alongside gentryifying neighborhoods, these ethnoburbs and enclaves are far from ghettos and are destinations of choice for foreign born residents who seek to maintain cultural identity and social ties. They are voluntary, and hold a high level of influence both here in the States and back home overseas. During the 2020 presidential campaign, the president of India held a rally with Donald Trump in Houston for the large and influential South Asian community in Houston. The event was called "Howdy, Modi!" and filled a stadium with 50,000 attenders for the more than 300,000 South Asian diaspora members who live in Houston and Dallas.[[['Howdy, Modi!': Thousands, plus Trump, rally in Texas for India's leader](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-india/howdy-modi-thousands-plus-trump-rally-in-texas-for-indias-leader-idUSKBN1W70B2), *Reuters*, Septermber 22, 2019.::rsn]]

Cultures within these enclaves are permeable--transferring ideas, symbols, and artifacts--but they are resilient. Distinct cultural and language groups remain. Any urban mission strategy attend this context with propular contextualization. A methodology that can first assess and discover these groupings and then develop unique disciple-making strategies, confronting worldview in a culturally appropriate manner.

## The Core Missionary Task as Framework for Cross-cultural Missions
New immigration requires a strategy that takes the occasion seriously and remains biblical but contextual to the realities of the situatio. Considering the central role of the church as the agent and fruit of God’s mission, local churches are positioned best for diaspora ministry in their own context. However, placing traditional churches, mostly from a majority American context, at the center of such a strategy requires training. 

Any equipping must encourage lay members that they can engage in effective cross-cultural missions. Too often, the idea of international missions being reserved for professionals with extensive training pervades the common ethos of churches. When confronted with people groups in their own cities, church members can be paralyzed by the conviction that some expertise is necessary to engage with these newcomers. Instead, equipping must demonstrate that cultural expertise is not the standard for faithful ministry and that simple methods of cultural acquisition allow for a discovery process to begin.

Churches cast a vision for members to participate in this mission, asking them to prayerfully consider involvement. As members are identified, a process of equipping them as a mission team within the church can begin. Ideally lay teams can be set up in churches that partner with other churches and parachurch organizations to share the gospel and plant churches among diaspora peoples in their context. Equipping requires a shift from primarily monocultural ministry philosphy and methods toward a cross-cultural understanding of the missionary task. In this way, local church equipping for diaspora missions should consider insihts from missionary practice overseas while allowing for the flexibility necessary to work in a North American setting.

One such framework is the Core Missionary Task (CMT) promoted by the International Mission Board (IMB) in its *Foundations* document. *Foundations* provides the theological and missiological grounding for the IMBs strategy formation and practices overseas. It is not a universal strategy but a framework that serves as the foundation for their missionary methods across the globe. In this manner, the (CMT) is a helpul guide for developing diaspora missions strategy at the local church level in North America.

The CMT includes six basic components central to the missionary task. These components are not strictly linear, but often follow the listed trajectory. These components include: entry, evangelism, discipleship, healthy church formation, leadership formation, and exit/partnership.[[*Foundations*, 75.::rsn]]

## Adapting the CMT to Local Church Diaspora Missions
Since the CMT is a general framework for particular missionary methods, it is easily adapted to use in the North American context by churches equipping members for a cross-cultural missions strategy. One potential example is the Peoples Next Door (PND) project, which equips churches to do this kind of ministry. The PND project breaks diaspora missions engagment down into three broad phases: discovery, engagement, and partnership.These three phases account for all components of the CMT and adapt them to use in unique settings.
### Discover
The first phase of a local church strategy should involve people group discovery. Discovery concerns both the *where* and the *who* of a particualr group of people. Discovery first seeks to understand the geogrpahic location and social circles of a given group. This involves finding a geographic cetner within an urban center if the group has one. It also involves locating points of interest where intersection with people from these groups can naturally occur. However, discovery does not stop at geographic information. It presses toward cultural acquisition as well. This involves culture, language, and worldview infromation tied to this particular grou of people in their location. Broad academic research about a group, such as South Asian Indians, is helpful but insufficient. Understanding background is only one step of cultural aquisition in a diaspora context. Since these groups are themselves in a new context, they will be contextually different from those within their home culture and worldview. These twin concerns of greography and group narrative drive the discovery process.

#### Discovery results in a map of the people group network
Discovery results in a map. This part of the process often feels daunting for lay members in churches, but it need not be complicated. Caleb Crider points to the significance of mapping for missions in *Tradecraft* and provides helpful guidance for local churches. Crider speaks of mapping in three layers: geographic, social, and spiritual. [[Crider, *Tradecraft*, 51.::rsn]] By identifying and cataloging points of interest, a local church can quickly and effectively develop a map that outlines both the social connectedness of a particular people and key spiritual categories of their worldview. A point of interest is any brick and mortar location—such as a business, market, restaurant, fabric store, or temple—that can be positively connected to a particular socio-cultural group. In this regard, lay teams seek to discover the West African hair braiding salons and the Halal meat markets that cater specifically to a given people. By cataloging these points of interest, the social and spiritual life of a group begin to take shape. Furthermore, these locations become points of entry into the community.

#### Discovery requires being a participant observer
Enoch Wan and Casey Anthony speak of the importance of being a participant observer in diaspora missions. They write,
>This insider’s approach allows for exploration of culture and worldview issues and often raises many new questions that need to be answered. Additionally, participant observation allows for the building of deep relationships during the research process … Along the way, the researcher will learn valuable vocabulary, idioms, habits, community gatekeepers and leaders, degree of people group networking and connectedness, and places of residence that will be essential for the church planting process in the future.[[Wan, *Church Planting among Immigrants in US Urban Centers*, 64.::rsn]]

Contrary to purely objective observation, participant observers enter into the story they are viewing. This is significant for the discovery process. It allows for an intimate look at culturel norms and key tenets of wordvliew necessary for proper contextualization. Furthermore, by taking the posture of the participant observer, relations for engagement are alreaduy formed in the discovery phase. Once a point of interest is entered, it can become a point of engagement and gospel ministry. Soon, shop owners and visitors become familiar faces, and the dialogue with questions of cultural acquisition forms the basis of relationships and conversation about the gospel.

Training modules for discovery in local churches should focus on both aspects of discovery. To this end, traning is necessary for members to know how to easily collect and catalogue information in order to develop a map. In addition, simple traning should be given on how to accomplish culture acquisition through participant observation. [[Examples of potential training components for discovery would include a simple understanding of culture based on the 5 Fs (food, finances, family, faith, and festivals) as well as key worldview questions to engage in dialogue. Finally, teaching people to use Google sheets and maps to easily plot out people group networks is a basic but helpful approach to information gathering.::rmn]]

>### Example of Discovery
>One local church in Raleigh, NC decided to encourage their congregation to begin people group discovery. In order to do so, they canvassed an area within a 10 minute drive of their facilities to collect points of interest for West Africans. Their results found over 30 places, markets and restaurants, that were connected to this diaspora group. At the conclusion of a worship service, a map was placed on the screen and an appeal was made to the congregation to take the next week and list out the things they are already doing in their life that could be done at one of these places, such as purchasing rice or other goods. Each church member was given a list of these locations as they left the service. Within a couple of months, numerous families within the church had developed personal relationships with West African families in the area, some having regular dinner invitiations.

### Engage

#### Diachronic and Synchronic Gospel Proclamation is important

#### The strategy must turn from personal evangelism to group Bible studies

#### The imporance of orality

#### Illustration: "Go and Tell" ESL

#### Begin Bible studies with Church Planting in Mind

#### Raise up leaders from within to continue the work of missio


### Partner
[[*This section needs to be expanded significantly.*::lmn]]
Three levels of partnership must be considered by churches engaging in immigrant missions. The first is cooperation with other majority culture churches in their area. The second is those churches that may have been planted as the result of their efforts in diaspora missions. Finally, the fastest growing church movements in America are currently among foreign born populations that come here as Christians. Existing churches must learn to fellowship and cooperate with these new churches.
