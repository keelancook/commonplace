**Summary:**
>The Bible tells the story of the Triune God who has a cosmic mission for his ultimate glory that is accomplished first through the creation of a place and (more importantly) a people and subsequently through the redemption and recreation of that people and place. The *mission dei* is Trinitarian in essence, cosmic in scope, and developed through God's covenants, which all find their *telos* in the person and work of Christ.

## Summary of God's Reign Motif
[[This summary is an adaptation from the summary provided by Ott, Strauss, and Tennent in *Encountering Theology of Mission (Ott, 2010)*.::rmn]]
* At creation, all is good and rightly ordered under the reign of God (Gen. 1-2).
* Sin enters the world because of humanity's decision to rebel against the reign of God. The entrance of sin fractures the relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation. (Gen. 3-4)
* In the immediate aftermath of the fall, God enacts a promised plan of redemtpion and salvation. (Gen. 3)
* This promise plan is then progressively revealed through a series of covenants that God makes with his elected people. The covenants focus attention toward the coming Messiah, the prophet, priest, and king, who will restablish God's reign over all humanity and creation.
* At the consummation, when history is done. God's reign will be fully restored over humanity (Ps. 96:10-13), over all nations (Isa 2:4, Rev. 19:15), and over all creation (Rom. 8:19-22). His kingdom will be established in full glory.
>The Kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.(Rev. 11:15b)

## The Mission of God is Trinitarian in Essence
As noted by Tennent in [[Invitation to World Mission (Tennent, 2010)]], the term mission was used exclusively by the church to refer to the action of the Trinity until the sixteenth century. At that time, Jesuits bega to use the word to refer to the propagation of the gospel. In recent years, a number of scholars are working to revive a robust Trinitarian missiology. Perhaps the headwaters of this movement within evangelicalism was Lesslie Newbigin's *The Open Secret*, where he proposed proper mission theology could only be reclaimed with a return to a Trinitarian understanding of mission.[[The Open Secret (Newbigin, ??), ??::rsn]] In the last decade, Timothy Tennent provided a Theology of Mission that attempts to recast mission in a robust Trinitarianism. Tennet outlines his entire theology of mission in a Trinitarian framework: the Father is the sender, the incarnate Son is the model embodiment of mission in the world, and the Holy Spirit is the empowering presence of all mission.[[Inivtation to World Missions (Tennent, 2010), 74.::rsn]]

While this is a welcome development, one must be careful not to divide the work of God in an unhelpful way. Since God is Trinity, it naturally follows that all three persons are equally involved in each aspect and in like purpose in the mission of God.

## The Mission of God is Cosmic in Scope
The mission of God is cosmic in its scope, a point that is demonstrated by two significance themes that run throughout the canon. The first is the theme of creation and recreation. The second is the nations theme that deals with all the peoples of the world.

### Recommended Sources:
* Goheen, *Let the Nations be Glad* speaks of the mission of God with the shorthand of redeeming his image-bearers and restoring his creation.
* Wright, *The Mission of God* has two chapters dedicated to the nations theme.
* Ott, Strauss, and Tennent, *Encountering Theology of Mission* also treat the nations theme extensively.

## The Mission of God Develops through the Covenants
>contrary to “covenant theology,” which has the tendency to speak of God’s one plan of salvation in terms of the “covenant of grace,” and contrary to “dispensational theology,” which tends to partition history in terms of dispensations, it is more biblical to think in terms of a plurality of covenants (e.g., Gal. 4:24; Eph. 2:12; Heb. 8:7–13), which are part of the progressive revelation of the one plan of God, and all of which reach their telos, terminus, and fulfillment in Christ. [[ God's Kingdom through God's Covenant (Gentry & Wellum, 2015), 251.::rsn]]

>As God acts to redeem, the covenants disclose God’s eternal plan and reveal many truths, such as: who God is, the purpose of our creation, and how we are to live in relationship with God and each other. [[ God's Kingdom through God's Covenant (Gentry & Wellum, 2015), 252.::rsn]]
