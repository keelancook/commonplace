## What is meant by "reaching a city"?
The term *reach* has a broad definition in Christian mission and ministry today. At the maximalist end is the aspiration to "redeem culture" and transform social and cultural norms, affecting a lasting and holistic change on the city that presses it closer to the kingdom of God. At the other end of the spectrum, a common minimalist definition is the distribution of gospel literature on someone's doorknob.[[For an example of the maximalist definition, see *To Transform a City* by Eric Swanson. For a minimalist definition see [Saturate USA](https://www.saturateusa.org/what-is-saturate-usa/).::rmn]]

Instead, Luke provides for us a better understanding of reaching a city or region in the book of Acts. Throughout his account, Luke provides summary statements which are intended to demonstrate the progress of the Christian mission and it's geographic explansion across the Mediterranean region. A pattern soon emerges in Luke's record, as his constant refrain is, "The Word of the Lord increased and multiplied." At least four different times, spaced out throughout his narrative, Luke reminds his reader of the growth of the gospel (Acts 6:7, 12:24, 13:49, 19:20), eventually saying that it increased and prevailed mightily. Luke's concern is the growth of the gospel, that every man woman and child would hear the message of Christ and his kingdom. Luke writes, "This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks" (Acts 19:20). Luke's concern aligns with the words of the prophet Habakkuk who longed for the knowledge of His glory to cover the earth as the waters covered the seas (Habakkuk 2:14). In short, the goal should be gospel saturation in this sense of the term.

North American cities today make gospel saturation a challenging goal.

## Move Past the Rhetoric of Multiplication.

## Develop within and Deploy out to the ends of the earth.

There are three phases in operating from a development paradigm:
1. Create a culture of healthy discipleship rich with a sense of sending from within for the Great Commission.
2. Develop intentional processes that create pathways toward sending for their own members.
3. Work together with other churches to accomplish the missionary task.
