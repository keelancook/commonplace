As God's New Covenant community, the church is responsible for the [[Mission of God's People]] in the time between the times, as we provide witness to the kingdom inaugurate by Christ and await it's final consummation.

This is a concise summary statement for the mission of the church:

>On behalf of the Father the church is sent by Christ the Son and empowered by the Holy Spirit to all nations as witnesses in order to make disciples for His glory.

## On Behalf of the Father, Sent by the Son, and Empowered by the Spirit (John 20:21)
>"As the Father has sent me, I (the Son) also send you.” After saying this, he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:21-22).

### Sent by the Son
Like God's people in prior covenants, the church must view her mission as a component of the Triune God’s cosmic mission of restoration for his ultimate glory. The mission of the church is clearly rooted in the larger [[Mission of God]]. It is often stated, the church doesn't have a mission, the mission of God has a church. This is good language when rightly understood. The church is not God's only means of accomplishing his mission, but it is his exclusive means of accomplishing aspects of it.

Goheen is helpful, though, in his four-part structure. As noted above on the mission of God, he claims it is to (1) redeem his image bearers and (2) restore his good creation. His understanding of the mission of the people of God (which he uses interchangeably with the church), has a vertical and a horizontal dimension: (1) worship God and (2) mediate blessing to the nations.[[Goheen's language here comes from his work, *A Light to the Nations*.::rsn]] While this is helpful shorthand, one must be careful not to overload the concept of blessing mediation with more than Scripture assigns to the church. Futhermore, it is entirely appropriate to nest the horizontal aspects of Goheen's understanding within the vertical aspect. For it is precisvely our service to God that presses us to be witnesses to the nations.

### Empowered by the Spirit
[[*Develop this aspect of this point further.*::lmn]]
* Prayer is a crucial part of the mission.
* The Holy Spirit is the one thing they are told to wait on after their commissioning.
