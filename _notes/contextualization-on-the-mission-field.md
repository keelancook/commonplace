## Notes from Critical Contextualization chapter of *Anthropological Reflections on Missiological Issues*
* Noncontextualization ironically leads to syncretism. When the pieces of worldview are not addressed by the gospel, they merely go underground. Christianity becomes a veneer over an old worldview. Western Protestant culture is passed on, but the underlying worldview remains unchanged. The result is a folk religion. [[Hiebert, Critical Contextualization, 106.::rsn]]
* On Critical Realism
** We see through a glass darkly, but we do see. (109)
* It's a process that spirals inward toward precision.
