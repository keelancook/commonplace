The following are the questions I was given for my PhD comprehensive exams. I include them here, because I believe they are some very fine questions that pull together several concepts that I plan to critically engage in this space. You can click through on any of the questions to see my notes.

1. Discuss the [[Biblical and Theological Basis for Missions]]. Include in your response relevant biblical texts and key resources that address this topic well.
2. Trace an historical analysis of American Protestant home missions methods toward immigrants during the first two decades of the 20th century (1900-1920). Provide clear evidence of knowledge of sources, events, and analysis.
3. Develop an [[Informed Strategy for US Immigrant Enagement]]in the 21st century. Include principles, application, and illustrations to describe the strategy.
4. State and defend your position on [[Contextualization on the Mission Field]]. Your response must include a definition of the term, arguments for and against contextualization, and your acceptable parameters for contextualizing (if indeed you argue that contextualization is permissible). Be certain to support your response with strong sources, including the Bible.
5. Develop a fully supported and clearly articulated response to the question, “How might the North American local church equip potential missionaries to reach cities for Christ?” Your response should reflect biblical, theological, and practical insights.
6. State and defend your method of evaluating whether a missionary is effective in his or her work. You may apply this answer to your current place of ministry, but your response must provide clear evidence of your knowledge of the missionary task and related resources.
7. Describe what you believe are the 3-5 most [[Critical Issues Facing North American Missionaries]] seeking to reach North America today. Be certain to support your conclusions with strong research.
8. Choose the two missiologists or writers whose works have been most influential on your approach to missions. Summarize their insights most helpful to you, providing evidence of your knowledge of their works.
