## Principles to consider in setting ministry boundaries
The development of boundaries within ministry is an essential skill that requires intentional development. A right philosophy of ministry boundaries is established upon a foundation of certain biblical principles.

### Your first covenant is with God.
A pastor shepherds his people out of the spiritual overflow of his own life. A rightly-ordered understanding of one's identity is necessary to healthy boundaries in ministry. Before being a pastor, or even a husband and father, a man is first a child of God. Failing to flourish in one's own spiritual formation through certain [[Spiritual Disciplines]] is a precondition for failure in pastoral ministry as well.

Take as first importance the words of Christ in John 15:4-5:
>Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without me. (John 15:4-5)

Do not mistake sermon preparation or academic study for sufficient replacements for pratices that lead to abiding in Christ. Certainly, sermon preparation should be edifying. If the text does not first master the preacher, how can it master the hearer? However, it is a pale replacement for spiritual formation, and pastors do well to understand the need for both.

### Pastor your family first.

[[Brian Croft provides a helpful resource titled [The Pastor's Family](https://amzn.to/3sgE8lM) on navigating pastoral ministry with your family in a healthy way.::rsn]]

Pauls'words concerning the qualifications for elders ring true:
>He must manage his own household competently and have his children under control with all dignity. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of God’s church?) (1 Timothy 3:4-5)

If one cannot first manage his own household, how can he pastor a church? Notice the priority given in this question. And lest one reduce manage to maintaining a heavy authority over the home, heed Paul's counsel elsehwere. Manageing a home requires sacrificial love and affection for those who are part of the family, especially ones wife.

Consider also Paul's admonition to husbands in Ephesians 5:
>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word. (Ephesians 5:25-26)

Paul uses the proper relationship between a husband and wife as an analogy to explain Christ and his church. However, it's important to see that this text also demonstrates that proper human relationship as well. Husbands give themselves up for their wives.

In practical terms, this means they get your first and best ministry time. Your wife and children are not a distraction from pastoral ministry, they are your first priority in pastoral ministry. Do not forget that your family are also church members and you will most certainly give an account for how you shepherd them.

### But, a shepherd should smell like his sheep.

[[I find Thabiti Anyabwile's writing compelling on pastoral ministry. It was from Thabiti that I first heard the phrase, "A shepherd should smell like his sheep." He provides a helpful resource in [Finding Faithful Elders and Deacons](https://amzn.to/39axgz7)::rsn]]

Finally, pastoral ministry is intensely interpersonal. A few errors are common here. First, as an overreaction to ministry philosophies that sacrificed family or spiritual formation, many young pastors today are frankly not giving enough with their time. A tension does exist, and it is unavoidable, between creating the appropriate space for personal and family health and giving as much as possible to your congregation. Gutters exist on either side of this road, and the wise pastor constantly evaluates to make sure their course is straight.

Second, many pastors today assume that most of their time should be spent in their study. Do not make the shallow mistake of assuming that a pastor is essentially a preacher. Preaching is one of the most important tasks of the pastor, at least in our current Western model for church practice. All pastors need time to think, pray, and study so that they can prepare to preach and teach the word to their congregation. This time is important, but only in rare situations should a pastor's schedule spend more time in study than in the lives and homes of their people. In rare instances, a pastor will have a large enough platform and a large enough church, that they can dedicate themselves primarily to the teaching and preaching ministry of the church. For this to be healthy; however, it requires other pastors who do speand adequate time in the other vital aspects of shepherding their congregation. Most pastors have to fulfill both responsibilities, and it is a mistake to weight too heavily toward sermon preparation.

Too much time in the study assumes that your 45 minutes in front of the congregation is your best teaching to them. It overlooks the incalculable value of sitting with someone in conversation, of taking someone with you on errands, of living life in front of and alongside those you pastor. [A shepherd should smell like his sheep.](https://keelancook.com/2012/10/08/a-consequence-of-ministry-dealing-with-sheep/) The best pastors prioritize time lived with their congregation over time preparing to speak at their congregation.


## How do you coordinate healthy boundaries in your ministry schedule?
In many ways, my work requires the same kind of tension as that of a pastor. Pastors are "on call" in order to minister to their congregation as needs arise. The work of associational leadership requires the same posture toward pastors. We have over 350 churches in our association, which results in constant needs arising across an array of ministry issues. It's easy to get overwhelmed by requests and a good desire to serve churches in their unique needs. Given the three priniciples states above, the following are practical steps I use to maintain (as best as possible) boundaries within my own ministry. 

### Count the cost in your schedule
* Be diligent in your scheduling. Signing on to a post in ministry means you give up the right to thoughtless time
* Assign the most important things the best time.
* Know the difference between urgent and important

### Minimize distractions and temptations
* Steward your mobile life
* Scheduling hacks
* Deep Work Ideas
* Communicating expectations - You have to teach the congregation where these expectations live.
    * When you can and can't be reached, and 
    * how you can be reached, and 
    * why you can be reached
    * Don't become a slave to voicemails, phone calls, and text messages.

### Be all in on what you're doing at the moment
* This is about inegrity to yourself and others
* Once time is carved out, use that time for it's intended purpose (or people)
