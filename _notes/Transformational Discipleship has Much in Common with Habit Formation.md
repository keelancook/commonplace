The concept of [[Transformational Discipleship]] essentially pushes against an [anemic understanding of discipleship](https://keelancook.com/2016/08/05/is-our-understanding-of-discipleship-anemic/) with a focus on all three [[Learning Domains]]. This requires, at minimum, a transformation not only in thinking but in behaviors as well. In that way, true discipleship has much in common with habit formation.

In his book [The Power of Habit](https://amzn.to/2PViZiY), Duhigg makes a case for the importance of critical consideration of habit formation and the processes that allow for changing habits. [[Lay out his process for the habit cycle and how to adjust this in order to change habits.::lmn]]

Duhigg's explanation of habits maps with an understanding of both intentional and unintentional practices in the Christian life. If discipleship changes practices, then the process through which it does so aligns with the concepts of habit change. Understanding this relationship provides a pathway for instilling concrete practices within the disciplship process that address not only cognitive and affective aspects of worldview, but also change behaviors as well.
