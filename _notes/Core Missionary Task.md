The core missionary task (CMT) is the language the International Mission Board uses to describe the center of their missions strategy.

The CMT consists of six phases:

1. Entry
2. Evangelism
3. Disciplship
4. Healthy Church Formation
5. Leadership Development
6. Exit/Partnership

These aspects of the task are not neccessarily linear, though they do follow a rough progression. Furthermore, the task is meant to be a spiral, in that once you reach the end, you begin partnering with the churches and leaders you've developed to further engage in the missionary task.
