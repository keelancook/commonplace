A number of recent books have been written on the importance of habits and on habit change management. The two most notable are perhaps the [[The Power of Habit (Duhigg, 2014)]] and [[Atomit Habits (Clear, 2018)]]. These works on habit formation provide insight for discipleship and spiritual formation, especially as it relates to spiritual disciplines. In fact, David Mathis employs habit language for spiritual disciplines in his book, [[Habits of Grace (Mathis, 2016)]].

## Insights for Duhigg and Clear
[[*This section needs to be completed from literature notes on these two books.*::lmn]]
