    * Soong Chan Rah and his stat about Boston churches in *The Next Christendom*
    * 60% of those coming self-report as Christians
    * Anecdotally - we're planting twice as many Hispanic churches in Houston as we are majority culture. Many of our replants make sense to transition toward Spanish speaking.
