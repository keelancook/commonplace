**Summary:**
>The Bible tells the story of the Triune God who has a cosmic mission for his ultimate glory that is accomplished first through the creation of a place and (more importantly) a people and subsequently through the redemption and recreation of that people and place. The *mission dei* is Trinitarian in essence, cosmic in scope, and developed through God's covenants, which all find their *telos* in the person and work of Christ.

## Summary of God's Reign Motif
[[This summary is an adaptation from the summary provided by Ott, Strauss, and Tennent in *Encountering Theology of Mission (Ott, 2010)*.::rmn]]
* At creation, all is good and rightly ordered under the reign of God (Gen. 1-2).
* Sin enters the world because of humanity's decision to rebel against the reign of God. The entrance of sin fractures the relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation. (Gen. 3-4)
* In the immediate aftermath of the fall, God enacts a promised plan of redemtpion and salvation. (Gen. 3)
* This promise plan is then progressively revealed through a series of covenants that God makes with his elected people. The covenants focus attention toward the coming Messiah, the prophet, priest, and king, who will restablish God's reign over all humanity and creation.
* At the consummation, when history is done. God's reign will be fully restored over humanity (Ps. 96:10-13), over all nations (Isa 2:4, Rev. 19:15), and over all creation (Rom. 8:19-22). His kingdom will be established in full glory.
>The Kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.(Rev. 11:15b)

## The Mission of God is Trinitarian in Essence
Since God is Trinity, it naturally follows that all three persons are equally involvd in each aspect and in like purpose in teh mission of God. 

As noted by Tennent in [[Invitation to World Mission (Tennent, 2010)]], the term mission was used exclusively by the church to refer to the action of the Trinity until the sixteenth century. At that time, Jesuits bega to use the word to refer to the propagation of the gospel. In recent years, a number of scholars are working to revive a robust Trinitarian missiology.
