# Mission of God's People

### The Church as God's New Covenant Community
>However, the fact that Christ has fulfilled the previous covenants does not entail that the earlier covenants have no value for us today or that we can jettison the Old Testament from our Bibles. After all, the previous covenants serve their role in God’s redemptive plan and revelation of himself; they are forever part of Scripture, which is for our instruction, growth, and ministry (2 Tim. 3:16–17). Yet, now that Christ has come, Christians are no longer under these previous covenants as covenants. A crucial implication of this point is that we, as new covenant believers, must view and apply the previous biblical covenants to ourselves in light of Christ, to whom each of the previous covenants pointed and who fulfills every aspect of them completely. This observation is crucial in discerning how the previous covenants “carry over” to Christians in regard to our lives.[[ God's Kingdom through God's Covenant (Gentry & Wellum, 2015), 254.::rsn]]
