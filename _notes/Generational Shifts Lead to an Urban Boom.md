After a long period of decentralization away from city centers and into suburban and exurban settings in the United States, several key factors contributed to a reversal of this trend. While all the variables are far too diverse to cover, the generational shifts occuring in the United States population were a significant contributor to this trend.  Benjamin Ross writes, â€œA decade into the new millennium, waves of upscale newcomers had washed across the entire island of Manhattan; reached through San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon; and touched nearly every corner of Washington, DC."[[Benjamin Ross, [*Dead End: Suburban Sprawl and the Rebirth of American Urbanism*](https://amzn.to/3tP33yl) (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), 127.::rsn]] The trend is evident in many urban centers across America.
