## A Whole Bible Theology of Mission
Wright is correct when he claims the "biblical basis for missions" conversation is often little more than scouring the text for out-of-context proofs for an already determined strategy.[[Wright, Christopher J. H. “Truth with a Mission: Reading All Scripture Missiologically.” *Southern Baptist Journal of Theology* 15.2 (2011): 4–14.::rsn]]  Wright is correct when he claims,
>"There should be no theology that does not relate to the mission of the church — either by being generated out of the church's mission or by inspiring and shaping it. And there should be no mission of the church carried on without deep theological roots in the soil of the Bible." [[[[The Mission of God's People (Wright, 2010)]]::rsn]]
