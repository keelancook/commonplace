You have stumbled into the little corner of the internet where I do my public thinking. By trade, I'm an evangelical missiologist and theologian. My family and I live in Houston where I serve [a network of roughly 340 Baptist churches](https://ubahouston.org) here in the city as  strategist. I'm also on faculty as an instructor of North American missiology for [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](https://sebts.edu).

Primarily, the notes in this commonplace book will deal with topics or theology and ministry. My hope is that by thinking in public, instead of keeping these notes closed up, my thoughts here will benefit others. And perhaps, these thoughts will be sharpened that was as well.

# The Commonplace Book.
The [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) has a long history and deep roots. For hundreds of years, scholars, writers, and thinkers in general carried what ammounts to a scrapbook that they used to compile all of their notes. The book captured thoughts and became a place where those thoughts sharpened each other, giving birth to new ideas.

Commonplace books have been used by many of the greatest minds. One of the earliest references to the concept are the works of Marcus Aurelius.[[[Aurelius, Marcus. The Thoughts of the Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus. Boston: G. Bell & sons, 1897.](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/qZ1fAAAAMAAJ?hl=en)::rsn]] They were common throughout the Rennaissance and have even been a mainstay of theologians. Many like Philliip Melanchthon publishing their works with the title *Commonplaces*.[[[Why are so many great Lutheran books called “Commonplaces” or “Loci”?](https://blog.cph.org/study/systematic-theology-and-apologetics/why-are-so-many-great-lutheran-books-called-commonplaces-or-loci)::rsn]]

Another, more recent, trend is the concept of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). A digital garden is an online space for public thinking and idea generation. If you're a scholar, researcher, or knowledge worker of any kind, you know what it's like to have a notebook full of half-baked ideas. Those of us who think and write for a living are contantly capturing ideas, and if we're not cafeul, that's as far as the process goes. By placing those notes back out in front of everyone, it creates a level of accountability to continue processing them. It also allows for the free exchange of ideas, which should be the goal of scholarship in the first place. That's when we turn a corner from [note taking to note making](https://nesslabs.com/from-note-taking-to-note-making).
